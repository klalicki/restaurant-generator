# restaurant-generator
A design brief generator for my students

## Background

In Spring 2023, I taught a branding & portfolio development course at SUNY New Paltz. As a part of this course, students are asked to build a brand system for a fictional restaurant. I built this webpage to help them decide on the attributes of their restaurant.

Upon load, this page selects a random combination of cuisine, restaurant type, and price point.
